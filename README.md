# 🐟 Atlantic Sturgeon Habitat Suitability Modeling

### 📍 Overview
This project models seasonal habitat suitability for **Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus)** in Chesapeake Bay tributaries using USGS and NOAA water quality datasets. The analysis integrates logistic regression in R with GIS-based spatial modeling to identify critical habitats for this federally endangered species.

### 🌊 Research Significance
Atlantic sturgeon are an anadromous, keystone species whose survival is directly tied to riverine habitat quality. Chesapeake Bay populations have declined drastically due to habitat loss and overfishing. Identifying environmental thresholds and predicting seasonal habitat patterns provides critical data for ongoing conservation and restoration initiatives.

### 👩‍💻 My Role
- Designed and implemented all statistical modeling and geospatial workflows.  
- Conducted logistic regression and regularized models to evaluate environmental predictors.  
- Processed and visualized seasonal suitability maps using QGIS and GRASS GIS.  
- Wrote the full report and developed the presentation for academic and conservation audiences.

- 🖥️ [Project Presentation](./sturgeon_presentation.pdf) – Visual summary of key findings and workflow.  
- 🗺️ [Seasonal Habitat Maps](./seasonalmaps.gif) – Animated visualization of predicted habitat suitability.  

### 🔬 Tools
- **R:** glm, caret, glmnet, pROC  
- **GIS:** QGIS, GRASS GIS, ArcGIS Pro  
- **Data:** USGS NWIS, NOAA Chesapeake Bay water quality datasets  

### 🚀 Future Directions
- Incorporate long-term time series to analyze interannual variability in habitat suitability.  
- Integrate telemetry data to validate model predictions with sturgeon movement patterns.  
- Develop a dynamic, interactive GIS tool for managers to visualize habitat suitability under different environmental scenarios and climate change projections.
